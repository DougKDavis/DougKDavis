- 👋 Hi, I’m @DougKDavis
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing and design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software for G-codes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a firmware for my Longer LK5 Pro 3D printing with a BLTouch.

- 📫 How to reach me to make fireware for my Longer LK5 Pro 3D Printer with a BLTouch V 3.1. Also hopefully using the existing color touch screen. Hopefully having the BL Touch make a grid of 25. (5 across and 5 up).
